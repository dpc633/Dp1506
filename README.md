**Fingerprint door lock system**



`	`The project is based on security purpose. With the use of Arduino you can open and close the door lock.

`	`The main purpose of the this system that we can open door with fingerprint as well as we can add fingerprints as much as we want and it is very cheaper that means anyone can afford it.

**Special Instruction**

`	`Before the uploading the final program we have to set main user fingerprint in fingerprint sensor

**Usage**

`	`This project can be used everywhere like at house, office or any private low budget safe locker.



**Team**





`		`The build team consists of:

- **Daksh Patel : -**  He did all coding, build circuit and apply new ideas**		
- **Manali Patel: -** She did all paper work like write-up project, gave some ideas for improve project



**Credits**



- **GitHub: -** We can get various idea about lot of things from GitHub.
